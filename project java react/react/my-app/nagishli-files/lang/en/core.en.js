Other scripts and website owners were pretty much "left out". Making a website accessible is a complicated and relatively long process (or at least that\'s how people describe it). Localize also needed a plugin for its own websites, and if you need to manage a few websites, the time and cost of making them accessible can be expensive.<br /><br /><span class="nagishli-u">Is it really free? Why?</span><br />The plugin was developed initially for Localize\'s personal use, which later decided to release it to the public in order to make every website accessible to impaired people.
